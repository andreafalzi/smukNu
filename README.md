This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

The project is hosted online [smuknu.andreafalzi.dev](https://smuknu.andreafalzi.dev).
 
To run the project locally, remember to follow these instructions:

- Clone the code from the repository
- Once inside the folder, run `npm install` to get all dependencies
- Finally, run `npm run dev` to start the project that opens on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## About

This is my final exam project which I had to develop following a specific Design template, provided by the school, along with precise guidelines such as colors, fonts etc ... The projects are mobile first and I have added some features that were optional such as the Store and the drop-down cart.
